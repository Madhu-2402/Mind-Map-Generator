# Mind-Map-Generator
My mind map generator is a dynamic web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create and customize mind maps with various node shapes. The project emphasizes user interaction by enabling content input within nodes and automatically generating arrows between connected nodes for a visually organized structure.
